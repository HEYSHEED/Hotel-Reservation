During this project, one of the main challenges I faced was connecting the application to the database and ensuring smooth communication between the front-end (JavaFX) and the back-end (DAO classes). Managing the navigation between multiple pages, as well as writing the DAO files and controllers, was more complex than I expected. I also encountered issues with retrieving complete data — for example, linking reservations to their related guest and room information — which caused NullPointerException errors until I carefully debugged and adjusted my SQL queries and object mapping.

Another challenge was handling search and filter features. At first, the search results were not updating the table correctly, especially after adding or cancelling reservations. I learned to separate the search logic from the initialization logic and to ensure that the DAO methods always return fully populated objects.

The use of logging, especially at the early stages, helped me a lot in tracking where the problems occurred. This allowed me to quickly identify missing data or incorrect method calls. I also benefited from a previous project I had worked on, which gave me experience in structuring a JavaFX MVC project and managing database operations through DAO classes.

Overall, I learned how important it is to carefully design the data flow between the database, the DAO layer, and the controllers, as well as the value of thorough debugging. I also improved my skills in JavaFX UI binding, SQL joins, and ensuring that the application remains stable even when data is missing or incomplete.
